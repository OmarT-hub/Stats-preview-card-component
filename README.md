## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup  
- CSS custom properties  
- Flexbox

I also improved my skills with CSS custom properties and mobile-first layout strategies.

### Continued development

In future projects I want to focus on:  
- More advanced CSS Grid layouts  
- Animations & transitions for interactive UI  
- Building components with accessibility in mind  

### Useful resources

- [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) — helped me format this README.  
- [MDN Flexbox Guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox) — great reference for responsive layout.
